It was really easy to pinpoint. I appreciate that and I admire Linus Torvalds, that arrogant bastard

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I can see different versions of my program and what each version solved. In case I mess up I can rollback to previous running version

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Manual commit make it clear and easier to understand later. Each commit solves a logical problem, so it is easy for us to track down later

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because most of the time, different files of a project are interrelated and it makes sense to save each file of a project

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
It is pretty easy, and helpful to track down

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I can keep track of each additional feature and helps me to backtrack when there is a problem

Yeah, made it! Going to do second commit!
